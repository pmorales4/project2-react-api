#Collection of Wireframe & Explanation:

The project two API I have chosen is News.org-api. I am looking to add eight components to the project. Within the eight components, five will pull data in order to populate their section of the application with news information. My thought process is to pull data within each of those components but I may see errors forthcoming within my application due to repetitiveness of code.

The forthocoming errors I will plan to fix by researching how to use one pull with several output components with data (news section within app). By drilling down I can fix whatever errors may happen throughout my project. Below you will see a wireframe of what the projects looks like at this time.
